# Hey there! I’m calledarian (Arian Khadem) 👋

Just a self-taught full-stack dev who loves turning ideas into real, working apps.

---

### What I’m up to these days

- Building stuff with **React** (plain JavaScript — because sometimes simplicity wins)
- Crafting backend APIs with **NestJS** and TypeScript — typed code keeps me sane
- Managing data with **PostgreSQL**
- Using **Docker** and **Git** to keep things tidy and easy to share
